For clarity, this 'Refund Guarantee' does not apply in the following cases: <br/> Personal reasons (such as not liking the product or it not meeting expectations); <br/> Financial reasons (such as not expecting to be charged, not anticipating that a trial would convert to a subscription, not expecting a subscription to auto-renew, or not anticipating the service to be paid). <br/> General Refund Rules <br/> Generally, if the conditions described above are not met, the fees you have paid are non-refundable and/or non-exchangeable, unless otherwise stated in the text or required by applicable law. <br/> Note for EU Residents: You explicitly agree to the immediate performance of this contract, and acknowledge that you lose your right to withdraw from the contract once our server verifies your purchase and it is successfully delivered to you. Therefore, you are not entitled to a refund unless the digital content is defective.</p>"
